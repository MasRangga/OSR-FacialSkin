# Open-Set Recognition on Facial Skin Diseases using QCPN and MobileNetV3 🧠🩺

This repository contains the implementation and experimental results of our research on applying **Open-Set Recognition (OSR)** methods to classify facial skin diseases. The method utilizes **Quad-Channel Contrastive Prototype Networks (QCPN)** in combination with **MobileNetV3**, aiming to handle unseen or unknown skin disease classes during testing.

## 🔍 Research Overview

Facial skin disease diagnosis often requires models capable of identifying **known diseases** while rejecting **unknown or novel classes** — a task not addressed by traditional closed-set classification. This research proposes a deep learning architecture based on **Quad-Channel Contrastive Prototype Networks (QCPN)**, leveraging **MobileNetV3** as the backbone. The model is evaluated on both **closed-set** and **open-set** scenarios to validate its robustness.
